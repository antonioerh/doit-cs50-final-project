# Doit
#### Video Demo: <>
#### Description: 
My final project is Doit, a web-based task management application built using Python, Flask, and SQLite for the backend, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend. I chose this project because it presented a manageable challenge; it allowed me to focus on consolidating the core technologies I learned during CS50, bridging the gap between server-side logic and user interface design without being overwhelmed by entirely unfamiliar tools.
