# Doit
#### Video Demo: <>
#### Description: 
My final project is Doit, a web-based task management application built using Python, Flask, and SQLite for the backend, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend. I chose this project because it presented a manageable challenge, since it allowed me to focus on consolidating the core technologies I learned during CS50, bridging the gap between server-side logic and user interface design without being overwhelmed by entirely unfamiliar tools.

When a user first visits the website, they are automatically redirected to the Login page, which I designed to be as flexible as possible. The login form accepts either a username or an email in the primary field. Underneath the sign-in button, I included a link for the Register page, ensuring that new users don't feel lost.
