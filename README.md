# Doit
#### Video Demo: <>
#### Description: 
My final project is Doit, a web-based task management application built using Python, Flask, and SQLite for the backend, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend. I chose this project because it presented a manageable challenge, since it allowed me to focus on consolidating the core technologies I learned during CS50, bridging the gap between server-side logic and user interface design without being overwhelmed by entirely unfamiliar tools.

When a user first visits the website, they are automatically redirected to the Login page, which I designed to be as flexible as possible. The login form accepts either a username or an email in the primary field. Underneath the sign-in button, I included a link for the Register page, ensuring that new users don't feel lost. The Register page has four required input fields: Email address, username, password, and a confirmation for the password. If the user fills out all the input fields correctly, they are automatically redirected to the main page of the web app (tasks.html). 

The main page displays a table of all ongoing tasks, allowing users to see their title, description, and due date, along with a check circle to mark them as completed. On the left side, there is a sidebar with four tabs: Tasks (the current tab), Completed, New Task, and Account. The Completed tab links to a page that displays another table of all finished tasks, allowing users to see their title, details, and the completion date. The New Task tab links to a page that displays a form to create a new task with three input fields: Title, Description, and a data picker for Due Date. Finally, the Account tab features a dropdown menu with two options: Profile Details, to view user information, and Logout, to end the session. In Profile Details, users can view their email address, username, and birth date, as well as change them along with their password. For security purposes, all changes require the user to provide their current password.
